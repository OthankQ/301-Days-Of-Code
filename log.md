# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: [2/1/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Read the first part of the chapter one of "You Don't Know Javascript". Skimmed through it really. Couldn't even begin the first challenge. Went back to reading the book carefully.

**Thoughts:**
Though I knew enough to start coding stuff. Looks like I really need to work on the basics first to do anything.

### Day 2: [2/2/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on the You Don't Know JS chapter 1 challenge.

**Thoughts:**
Couldn't quite get the code to run yet. Will have to work on it some more. But I feel like I wrote something I can actually understand.

### Day 3: [2/3/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Built a landing site for a business idea my friends came up with.

**Thoughts:**
Although it wasn't built from scratch, it was a good html and css practice.

Private Github repository.



### Day 4: [2/4/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Read through the first chapter of You Don't Know Javascript and finished the challenge. Not quite satisfied with the result. Read a bit of PHP tutorial.

**Thoughts:**
Some people say PHP is out of date. Is it worth checking it out currently? Also, need to put more time into coding.

### Day 5: [2/5/2019]

### Day 6: [2/6/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Finished structuring the html for the portfolio project on FCC. Looking into the Odin Project for more resources. First time contributing to an open source, although it was just a small typo. Kinda excited!

**Thoughts:**
It was first time ever contributing to a project. I had to look up how to send a good pull request message but it was worth it!
