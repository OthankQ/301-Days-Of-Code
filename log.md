# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: [2/2/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Read the first part of the chapter one of "You Don't Know Javascript". Skimmed through it really. Couldn't even begin the first challenge. Went back to reading the book carefully.

**Thoughts:**
Though I knew enough to start coding stuff. Looks like I really need to work on the basics first to do anything.

### Day 2: [2/3/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on the You Don't Know JS chapter 1 challenge.

**Thoughts:**
Couldn't quite get the code to run yet. Will have to work on it some more. But I feel like I wrote something I can actually understand.
