# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: [2/1/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Read the first part of the chapter one of "You Don't Know Javascript". Skimmed through it really. Couldn't even begin the first challenge. Went back to reading the book carefully.

**Thoughts:**
Though I knew enough to start coding stuff. Looks like I really need to work on the basics first to do anything.

### Day 2: [2/2/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on the You Don't Know JS chapter 1 challenge.

**Thoughts:**
Couldn't quite get the code to run yet. Will have to work on it some more. But I feel like I wrote something I can actually understand.

### Day 3: [2/3/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Built a landing site for a business idea my friends came up with.

**Thoughts:**
Although it wasn't built from scratch, it was a good html and css practice.

**Link to work:**
Private Github repository.



### Day 4: [2/4/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Read through the first chapter of You Don't Know Javascript and finished the challenge. Not quite satisfied with the result. Read a bit of PHP tutorial.

**Thoughts:**
Some people say PHP is out of date. Is it worth checking it out currently? Also, need to put more time into coding.

### Day 5: [2/5/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Started and finished the Technical Documentation Page project on FCC. But barely put any styling into it. Still struggling with CSS layouts.

**Thoughts:**
I feel like I still have trouble with CSS layouts in general and coming up with good ways to lay things out.

### Day 6: [2/6/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Finished structuring the html for the portfolio project on FCC. Looking into the Odin Project for more resources. First time contributing to an open source, although it was just a small typo. Kinda excited!

**Thoughts:**
It was first time ever contributing to a project. I had to look up how to send a good pull request message but it was worth it!

### Day 7: [2/7/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on data structure challenges on FCC.

**Thoughts:**
Handling arrays. Not too difficult, but I am confused of the reduce() function.

### Day 8 :[2/8/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Coding wise, didn't do much today. Just a couple of javascript challenges on free code camp. Struggled for a while trying to install Xubuntu on a windows virtual machine to set up a Ruby on Rails app. Still struggling.

**Thoughts:**
Want to start project odin soon...

### Day 10 :[2/10/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Couldn't help but feel like I'm missing some of the fundamentals of programming. Listened to some lectures by Simon Allardice. Great lecturer. Didn't do much of coding today though.

**Thoughts:**
Fundamentals are important.

### Day 12 :[2/12/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Read about relational database and went over SQL challenges on codecademy to get a sense of what the language looks like.

**Thoughts:**
Never thought of looking into database manipulation, but looks a lot of fun!

### Day 13 :[2/13/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Following a tutorial on how to setup a Facebook messenger bot using Node.js and Dialogflow. Currently having trouble with ngrok proxy server. I keep getting 502 bad gateway error.

I have no clue why it's not working, yet.

### Day 14 :[2/14/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Was successful on hooking up my webhook server to the Facebook bot page! Will try to hook up APIs to the bot and see if I can make it do what I want!
**Thoughts:**
I'm thinking I want to hook up a sports article webpage API to the bot so it can fetch me recent updates on F1 when I ask for them.

### Day 15 :[2/15/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Still working on my Facebook messenger bot. But meanwhile, also working on the free code camp JS curriculum. Trying to solve 'Iterating through all array items using for loops.' 
**Thoughts:**
Asked one of my friends why the code isn't working. He has a CS background but couldn't figure it out. I don't feel so bad now. Will tackle it again as soon as possible!

### Day 18 :[2/18/2019]
