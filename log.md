The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: [2/1/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Read the first part of the chapter one of "You Don't Know Javascript". Skimmed through it really. Couldn't even begin the first challenge. Went back to reading the book carefully.

**Thoughts:**
Though I knew enough to start coding stuff. Looks like I really need to work on the basics first to do anything.

**Today's Progress**
Built a React app with a list of user card and search function that updates as you type in a search term.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 74 :[4/16/2019]

**Today's Progress**
Back to learning Redux. Following through the Redux part of Stephen Grider's tutorial to get an idea of the whole picture of how React and Redux work together. Added connect and provider component to the project.

**Thoughts:**
Considered whether to continue with Andrei's course. However I think it is better to finish the Redux and get better understanding of the React ecosystem before moving onto backend.

### Day 76 :[4/18/2019]

**Today's Progress**
Learned about Redux-Thunk and how it can be used to make API calls within Redux action creators with async/await.

**Thoughts:**
Might have to go over it again to have a good grasp on the concept. On a side note, I'm considering learning Typescript.

### Day 77 :[4/19/2019]

**Today's Progress**
Got stuck hard trying to learn Redux-Thunk. Played around with Node modules like chalk and yargs. Learned a bit about filesystem.

### Day 78 :[4/20/2019]

**Today's Progress**
Went back to learning basics of Redux to get a good grasp before I went back to learning Redux-Thunk. Remade the music details app. Node wise, I'm currently putting together a CLI notes taking app. Implemented adding and delete functions.

**Thoughts:**
I think it's good to learn React-Redux and Node.js at the same time. Makes things fresh when I'm worn out on either one so that way I can keep coding!
